#Vanna Exposure (Naive)

This calculates Vex per $1 move in the underlying asset. Based on open interest.

(Currently it only works for option contracts in the current month.)

The VEX is displayed in millions.

VEX based on Open Interest:

Option's Vanna * Contract Size * Open Interest * Spot Price * Volume
Total VEX = Call VEX - Put VEX
